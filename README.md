# MEDTOUREASY
Project is made On the Prediction Of the Blood Donations ,
Dataset Provided by the medtoureasy was of peoples with there frequency of blood donation during month and recancy of the blood donation , 
the task was to predict that the respected person will donate the blood or not? ,
so i developed the ML model with the help of Logistic regression algorithm which helps to give the result whether the person will donate the blood or not. 
based on their previous blood donation Frequency and recancy.
'cc of blood' is the column which has the values in 4 digits , algorithm needs the data in single or similar value levels ,so i used np.log() , to convert the data into
single digit format.
2nd Task was to Create the Best ML pipeline , i used the TPOTCLASSIFIER algorithm , which gives the best ML pipeline path for our dataset .
